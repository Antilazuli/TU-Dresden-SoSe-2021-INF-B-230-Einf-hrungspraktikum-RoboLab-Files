The PID controller handles all of the robot controls and makes it easy to include them in the other parts of the project, with commentary on all methods included (works with VS Code).
The odometry module while being right on a theoretical term wasn't functioning properly with our robot. I recommend using as small wheels as possible and placing the sensor as near as possible to the wheels axis.
